#Watchlist App

Just another movie/series watch list app.

Just for fun, written in es6, using Angular and a little php to maintain a movie/documentary/series watchlist.

##To do

- favicon
- mark as watched
- score
- edit item
- make more sense of seasons watched
- only commit versions on master?
- add # episodes to season? or add an actual list... with titles?
